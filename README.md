# UWaterlooOpenRecSchedule

UWaterlooOpenRecSchedule is an attempt to create a more intuitive schedule which allows the user to easily get times by activity

This extension basically does 4 things on https://warrior.uwaterloo.ca/Facility/GetSchedule :
- Adds a filter bar under the facility selection box
- Filters out timeslots not containing the whatever you type in the filter bar
- Removes the term and the year from the activity you searched for (there's no point having the entire schedule display something like Spring 2018 in front of all activities right?)
- Clicking on the icon takes you to the schedule
